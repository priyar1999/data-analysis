# Data-Analytics
This includes all the mini projects that i've been working on,using python libraries available for data analysis and visualization like: pandas, numpy, sklearn, seaborn, scipy etc. Files consist of work where i have cleaned and pre-processed the data and then have tried to derive some solutions and insights to that raw data.
Work is from finding insights to generating the confidence intervals and visualizing them using different plots. I have also done a few mini projects on multiple linear regression.
