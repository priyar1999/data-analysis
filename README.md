# Data-Analytics
This includes all the mini projects that i've been working on,using python libraries available for data analysis and visualization like: pandas, numpy, sklearn, seaborn, scipy etc. Files consist of work where i have cleaned and pre-processed the data and then have tried to derive some solutions and insights to that raw data.
